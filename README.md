## Overview

NetAssistant is a high-performance, modern network debugging tool built with Rust. It provides an intuitive interface for testing and debugging network communications with support for TCP/UDP protocols in both client and server modes.

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Protocol Support**: TCP/UDP client and server modes
- **Chat-Style Message Log**: Intuitive display of message interactions
- **Configuration Persistence**: Automatically save connection configurations
- **Auto-Reply Functionality**: Automatic response support for testing
- **Multi-Tab Management**: Manage multiple connections simultaneously
- **Client Message Viewing**: Select specific clients to view their messages

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or higher
- Windows 10/11 or Linux

### Installation

Please visit the [GitHub Release page](https://github.com/sunjary/netassistant/releases) to download the latest version.

### Running

After downloading, extract the package and run the executable file.

## 💡 Usage

1. **Create Connection**
   - Click the `[+ New]` button in the left panel
   - Select connection type (Client/Server)
   - Choose protocol (TCP/UDP)
   - Enter address and port

2. **Connect to Server**
   - For client connections, click the `[Connect]` button
   - For server connections, click the `[Start]` button

3. **Send Messages**
   - Enter message content in the bottom input field
   - Click the `[Send]` button or press Enter to send

4. **Auto-Reply**
   - Enable auto-reply in the connection tab
   - Set the auto-reply content
   - Automatically reply when messages are received

5. **Manage Connections**
   - Use tabs to switch between different connections
   - Click `×` on the tab to close the connection
   - Right-click on a connection to delete saved configurations

6. **Client Message Viewing**
   - In server mode, the left panel displays all connected clients
   - Click on a client address to select it, and the right message list will only show messages from that client
   - Click on an already selected client to deselect it and resume showing all messages
   - Server replies to that client will also be included in the viewed results
